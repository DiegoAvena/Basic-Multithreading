# Basic-Multithreading
Demonstrates the use of multithreading in Java by running 2 threads: 1 thread prints Marco every 10 secs for a total of 10 times, and another thread prints Polo with a newline character appended every 10 secs for a total of 10 times. There are no measures taken to synchronize these 2 threads.
